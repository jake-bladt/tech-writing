# Feature States should fall into three categories

## Overview

For effective tracking of work, all feature states should be solidly centered on "at rest," "work in progress," or "inventory." (Ready for vs In)

WIP/Inventory is a meaningful metric that can be addressed for improvement (not like "effort points.")

## Example

* New (At Rest) - Some tickets are just ideas for now.
* Ready for Grooming (Inventory)
* In Grooming (Work in Progress)
* Ready for Design (Inventory)
* In Design (WIP)
* Ready for Tests (Inventory)
* Writing Tests (WIP)
* Ready for Development (Inventory)
* In Development (WIP)
* In Review (WIP)
* In Build (WIP)
* In Production (At Rest)
