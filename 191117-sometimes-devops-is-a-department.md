# Sometimes, DevOps is a department and that's okay

"DevOps has to be a top-down change." - Jason Helmick in his Pluralsight video, "Infrastructure from Code: The Big Picture."

It has to come from the leadership team. 

A couple of lessons I got from _The Phoenix Project_ that may not have been intended:

* Management generally won't change things until you're 90 days away from the company being dismantled for parts.
* Unless you're a manager (or Brent,) you don't get a name. Some of us are just "Chris's developers."
