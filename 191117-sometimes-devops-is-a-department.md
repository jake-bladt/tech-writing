# Sometimes, DevOps is a department and that's okay

It's possible to do a lot of reading on DevOps and still not be able to answer the basic question of, "What exactly is DevOps?" Even Pluralsight experts on the subject admit that any definition will get you in trouble because it misses some aspect considered crucial in a different shop or includes some aspect that a viewer considers non-essential. (Needs direct quote.) The definitions you get all revolve around a culture of trust, open communication, and collaboration.

One thing all the experts seem to agree on is what DevOps isn't: It's not a product you buy and it absolutely, positively is not a department. "Having a department in charge of DevOps is like having one person responsible for collaboration." (Attribution?)

The immediate problem with describing DevOps purely as a culture is that trust, open communication, and collaboration are essential to most work methodologies. In software development, they go back at least as far as Alistair Cockburn's _Crystal_ family, introduced at the turn of the century. And, while there may be methodologies that work best under a veil of secrecy, distrust, and knowledge hoarding, the practiotioners probably aren't going to be writing books about it any time soon.

DevOps is about hiring smart people and trusting them to do what you hired them for. Bureaucracy is about hiring interchangable cogs and wrapping them in control structures so they can't do too much damage.

"DevOps has to be a top-down change." - Jason Helmick in his Pluralsight video, "Infrastructure from Code: The Big Picture."

It has to come from the leadership team. 

A couple of lessons I got from _The Phoenix Project_ that may not have been intended:

* Management generally won't change things their own jobs are in immediate jeopardy. Radical changes won't happen until you're 90 days away from the company being dismantled and sold off in parts.
* Unless you're a manager (or Brent,) you don't get a name. Some of us are just "Chris's developers."

As harsh as these conclusions may sound, they're almost certainly true to your organization's management. Because DevOps is first and foremost a culture, it needs buy-in from the top if it's going to work and implementing DevOps in spite of upper management is a near-impossible task.

On the other hand, imposing DevOps from the top isn't much easier. A lot of the core philosophies buck our basic instincts. Prioritizing ease-of-deployment over customer-facing features requires a kind of forward-thinking that modern corporatism with its focus on the next quarter's profits discourages. "Rush to failure" is a career-level trust-fall that most organizations haven't earned. "Be open and honest. Risk your job to make the company better. Management has your back." is up there with "We're from the government and we're here to help."
